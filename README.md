# Physics Simulator

A simple physics simulator to simulate orbit and ball bouncing/collision.

Uses RK4 to approximate position given only force. All simulation components are done using force.

Made as a TA for Brookline High School 21/22 AP Physics.

## Setup

Install packages from requirements.txt

## Ball bouncing

Can change speed of simulation, size of ball, shape of bounds, and other constants by editing walls.py.

## Orbit

Can change size, mass, and position of earth and moon, as well as other constants by editing orbit.py

## Springs

Work in progress. Currently not functional.
